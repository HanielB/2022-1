## A bit of history

- ML was designed by Robin Milner and others on the early seventies.

- ML has many dialects, we will be using SML, which stands for Standard ML.

- It was designed as the meta-language (ML stands for "meta-language") for LCF
  (Logic for Computable Functions)

- LCF was one of the first automated theorem provers, which are tools that
  automate logic reasoning to prove theorems. Current automated theorem provers
  to use ML as meta-language include HOL4 and Isabelle.

- One of the few languages to have been completely formally specified. Link

- There is even a formally verified compiler for a substitiantial set of
  SML, CakeML.

- We will be using mostly interpreted ML.

## Topics covered

- Using the interpreter
- Equality types and reals
- Lazy evaluation
- Overloaded operators
- Variable declaration
- Tuples
- Lists
